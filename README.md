# A Startup App for Monitoring Oracle DB

## Abstract
A Desktop tool, which was developed by using Java, is aimed to administer an Oracle DB Instance initially, but only a simple monitoring property added and left as an incomplete project. Indeed, it's quite open for improvement. 

## How to Use

 You can start operating after entering credentials such as DB username, password and connection string like illustrated as a tooltip
for the third text field. As the credentials are entered, their list is topped as the connection shortcut info, activated by the right-upper
button. 
 
 You can determine the desired color from the palette and the language(there exist only three of them currently) during the enterance. 

## IDE used
