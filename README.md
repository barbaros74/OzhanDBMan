# A Startup App for Monitoring Oracle DB

 You can start operating after entering credentials such as DB username, password and connection string like illustrated as a tooltip
for the third text field. As the credentials are entered, their list is topped as the connection shortcut info, activated by the right-upper
button. 
 
 You can determine the desired color from the palette and the language(there exist only three of them currently) during the enterance.
